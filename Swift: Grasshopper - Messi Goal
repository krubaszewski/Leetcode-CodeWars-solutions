Task:
Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
la_liga_goals
champions_league_goals
copa_del_rey_goals
Create a fourth variable named total_goals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.*/


func totalGoals(laLigaGoals: Int, championLeagueGoals:Int, copaDelReyGoals:Int) -> Int{

    totalGoals =  laLigaGoals + championLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals
    return totalGoals
}

totalGoals(laLigaGoals: 43, championLeagueGoals:10, copaDelReyGoals:5)

//Much easier and simplified:
//var laLigaGoals = 43
//var championLeagueGoals = 10
//var copaDelReyGoals = 5

//var totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals
